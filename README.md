# halal-food-detector
An Android App built in Java/XML.

This was our semester project in 5th semester of BS CS. It works by taking a photo of ingredients of anything. Then uses OCR to convert them to text and then matches them with a database of E-codes and their halal status. Then it tells the user whether the product is halal or not.
